Web Page Implementation â€“ HTML, CSS, Accessibility, Responsive Design

This project is a from-scratch implementation of a fully functional and responsive web page, built entirely with pure HTML and CSS. No external libraries or frameworks were used, ensuring a focus on core web development skills. The goal was to recreate the provided designer file with precision while incorporating accessibility best practices and responsive design principles.

The page is structured with semantic HTML to enhance SEO and usability, styled with modern CSS techniques, and optimized for viewing across devices using a mobile-first approach. Flexbox, Grid, and media queries are applied to adapt layouts seamlessly for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Accessibility considerations include proper heading hierarchy, descriptive alt text for images, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes where appropriate.

To view the project, simply open the index.html file in any modern browser. The design matches the reference file closely while maintaining performance, accessibility, and clean, maintainable code.
