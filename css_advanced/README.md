# CSS Advanced Concepts Project

This project is all about diving deep into CSS and mastering how it styles webpages. Using only HTML and CSS. I’m building a webpage that closely follows a detailed Figma design, focusing on getting every style detail right without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

Throughout this project, I worked on understanding the core concepts of CSS — from how styles apply to elements, using classes and selectors, to figuring out CSS specificity and the box model properties like margin, padding, and borders. It also helped me learn how browsers load and render webpages with applied styles.

The fonts used in the design are Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT, so I made sure to install and use them for an accurate match. Some of the design specs include decimal values, so I rounded those where necessary to keep things consistent.

Overall, this project pushed me to carefully translate a complex design into a real, functioning webpage using pure web technologies, improving both my CSS skills and my eye for detail.
